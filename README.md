# Cygwin64 related branch
The reason I created this repository that I got really tired of making all my
home directories on different linux distributions.

This branch contains the ubuntu1604 related general files. To check my personal
one checkout ubuntu1604_mine branch.

## Getting started
If you have already made the git setup written in master branch, there is
nothing else to do.
